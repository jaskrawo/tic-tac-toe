# tic-tac-toe
Simple AI that plays tic-tac-toe with itself. At the beginning it choses moves to play randomly, every possible move has the same probability of being played. Sequences of moves that lead to victory get points, thus there will be a higher chance of choosing those moves in the future games. Accordingly moves that ended in a losing state will be chosen less frequently. After about 200 000 games there will be more than 99% of draws - both players will not make single mistake in more than 99% of games.
